// Remember that protocols act as a kind of contract. AVAudioRecorder does not know what classes you have in your app. However, if you say that your class conforms to the AVAudioRecorderDelegate protocol, then it knows it can call a specific function in your class.
// The specific function has been defined in the protocol (in this case, the AVAudioRecorderDelegate protocol). This way your class and the AVAudioRecorder are loosely coupled, and they can work together without having to know much about each other.
